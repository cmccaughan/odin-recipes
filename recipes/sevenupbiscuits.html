        <h3>If you're looking to experiment in the kitchen, there's not a better place to start than with 7-Up Biscuits.</h3>
        <p>Created by brighteyes_22, you'd never believe that these biscuits have only four ingredients and one of them is soda! They can be whipped up in no time and come out light and fluffy with a decadent flavor. Serves 8.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups all-purpose biscuit baking mix</li>
            <li>1/2 cup 7-Up soda (or other lemon-lime soda)</li>
            <li>1/2 cup sour cream</li>
            <li>1/4 cup butter, melted</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Grease a large baking sheet.</li>
            <li>Whisk baking mix, lemon-lime soda, sour cream, and melted butter in a bowl until batter is smooth. Drop biscuits by large spoonful onto the prepared baking sheet.</li>
